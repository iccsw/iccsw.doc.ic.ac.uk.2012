## Technical Track, Panels, Poster Session, and One Minute Madness

The workshop offers a traditional track featuring technical papers,
poster session and panel discussions focused on current topics in
computer science.

### Technical Track

This track is a general computing track for both theoretical and applied
approaches. Areas of interest for the technical track cover all fields
of research in computer science, including (but not limited to) the
following:

* Computer Systems
* Databases
* Logic and Artificial Intelligence
* Networks and Communications
* Programming Languages
* Software Engineering
* Theory of Computational Systems
* Verification and Model Checking

### Poster Session

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to share and
discuss new ideas and interesting preliminary work. Poster presenters
will have the entirety of the evening reception to discuss their work,
get exposure and receive feedback from attendees. All students who have
a paper accepted for the workshop are welcome, but not required, to
submit the poster.

### Panel Discussions

The goal of the panel dicussions is to stimulate engaging and
thought-provoking discussions on current topics in computer science as
well as promising areas of interests. Please submit topic suggestions
via email to [iccsw@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:iccsw@imperial.ac.uk) by
Friday, June 29, 2012, 11:59 p.m. BST.

### Gone in 60 Seconds

The workshop will also include a “one-minute madness” session at the
start of the event. In this session, all participants will be given a
one-minute opportunity to speak about their work. The hope is that these
short presentations will drum up interest in the presenter’s work and
encourage discussion between presenters and attendees.

## Guidelines

### Formatting

Papers are due by Friday, June 29, 2012, 11:59 p.m. BST. Since the aim
of the workshop is to provide a venue for early-stage researchers to
discuss their ongoing research. Submissions for the technical track are
limited to 5 pages in [OASIcs
style](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/oasics/oasics-authors.tgz). This
does not include the bibliography. Each student submitting a paper will
be asked to review at least one other submission from his or her area of
expertise.

To submit a poster, please submit a draft of your poster, in PDF (A1
size), together with an extended abstract (up to 2-page), by August 31,
2012, 11:59 p.m. BST. Poster submissions must include the authors’
names, affiliations, and contact information. Authors are not required
to print their own posters; the workshop committee will handle this and
also cover the cost of the print.

Papers that do not comply with the submission requirements, including
length and format, may be rejected without review. 

### Submission site

Submission of papers and posters should be done via
[EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw2012).

### Refereed Papers

Both papers and posters that have been formally reviewed and accepted
will be presented during the workshop. It is expected that one of the
paper authors will attend the conference and present the work. It is the
responsibility of the authors to find a suitable replacement presenter
for their work.

The proceedings will be published as an open-access volume in the
[OpenAccess Series in Informatics
(OASIcs)](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics) published by
[Schloss Dagstuhl](http://www.dagstuhl.de/). These will be provided to
the participants in electronic format at the time of the workshop.
